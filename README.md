# Full Stack Open Part 4 - BlogList

This repository has my solutions for the University of Helsinki Full Stack Open 2025, Part 4 (Blog List App).

I did the exercises 4.1–4.23 on my tablet because StackBlitz was not working.  
All code and written answers are saved here on GitHub.

The exercises include:
- Backend setup with Express and MongoDB  
- Testing with Jest and Supertest  
- User login and authentication  
- Refactoring with async/await
